v1.0 release: in paper first submission.

*Changed Keras to accept X_val like PyTorch, and not rely on validation split -> config.validation_split removed 
	*both libraries now support X_val, y_val as optional parameters, and will checkpoint according to either the val metric or acc metric depending if those are supplied
*Changed output directory format to use os.path.pardir to remove OS dependency.
*Changed to standardise model saving code
*Changed model loading to take full path, to easier load models from other repos/directories
*Added supplementary material for manipulating dataframes. Note that without the audio for the new metadata, the notebook `supplement.ipynb` will not run. Data cannot be released from the new metadata for privacy reasons.
